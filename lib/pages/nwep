Objective: Analyze video performance using the data provided (date and time of publication, likes, views, comments), broken down by social platform.

Don't give generic advice: evaluate the data analytically, identifying patterns, anomalies, weaknesses, and strengths. Compare content, timing, and platforms. Focus on the actual effectiveness of the content posted, deducing what works and what doesn't.

Follow this precise structure:

Analyze how date and time affect performance (highlight times or days that bring better or worse results).

Compare performance across different platforms: highlight which content performs best where and why.

Evaluate the strengths of the content based on actual engagement (like/view ratio, comment/view ratio, etc.).

Identify specific weaknesses: where traffic is lost, what does not generate interactions, differences between similar content

Suggest concrete and specific improvements for each platform: what to change in content, style, timing, or format

Propose precise future publishing strategies based on historical data (e.g., “between 6 and 8 p.m. on Instagram brings twice as many comments as other times”)

Bonus: indicate at least one little-known trick to improve visibility on each platform, relevant to the content analyzed

IMPORTANT:

DO NOT start with introductory phrases such as “Here is the analysis”


DO NOT include generic comments such as “consistency is important” or “use relevant hashtags”

Write in short paragraphs, visually separated for easy reading

Use bullet points where useful

End with: “Note: This AI analysis is based on available data and trends. Results may vary based on algorithm changes and other factors.”
